# 👋 Hi, I’m Debasish Mohanty

### Quality Engineering Platform Builder · Cloud-Native QA · Release Intelligence

I design Quality Engineering platforms that convert UI, API, and CI/CD test execution into actionable release intelligence for cloud-native systems.

Quality is engineered as a system — not validated as a phase.

🧠 What I Focus On

• Risk-based testing and critical test impact analysis
• CI/CD-driven quality signals for release confidence and decision-making
• Predictable, low-risk releases through early defect containment
• Cloud-native Quality Engineering platforms on AWS and Kubernetes

🛠 Core Stack

Testing: Selenium · RestAssured · TestNG · Allure
CI/CD: GitHub Actions · Jenkins · Tekton · ArgoCD
Cloud & Platform: Docker · Kubernetes · AWS · Istio
DevSecOps & Delivery: GitOps · Policy-as-Code · Canary Delivery
