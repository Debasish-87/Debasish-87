# 👋 Hi, I’m Debasish Mohanty

### Staff / Senior SDET · Quality Engineer · Quality Intelligence Architect

I design **Quality Intelligence systems**, not just test automation.

My work transforms **UI, API, and CI/CD test execution into release-critical insights** that enable **data-driven Go / No-Go decisions** for cloud-native platforms.

I specialize in:
- **Risk-based testing & critical test impact analysis**
- **Pipeline-driven quality visibility**
- **Predictable releases with early defect containment**
- **High-confidence production deployments on AWS & Kubernetes**

> Quality is engineered as a system — not validated as a phase.

## 🧠 What I Do (Beyond Automation)

✔ Convert automated test signals into **release confidence metrics**  
✔ Build **CI/CD-native QA platforms** (not siloed frameworks)  
✔ Enable **shift-left & shift-right quality** in microservices ecosystems  
✔ Reduce **mean time to detect (MTTD)** and **mean time to release (MTTR)**  
✔ Partner with Dev, DevOps, and Security to **engineer quality at scale**

## 📈 Engineering Philosophy

- Quality must be **observable, measurable, and actionable**
- Automation without insight is **just execution**
- Pipelines should **block risk, not just deploy code**
- QA must scale **with architecture, not against it**
