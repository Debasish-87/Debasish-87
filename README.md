👋 Hi, I’m Debasish Mohanty
SDET | Quality Engineer

Quality Intelligence · Release Engineering · CI/CD Automation

I build quality intelligence systems, not just automation frameworks.
My work converts UI, API, and CI/CD test execution into release-critical insights that enable data-driven Go / No-Go decisions.

I specialize in risk-based testing, critical test impact analysis, and pipeline-driven quality visibility for cloud-native platforms.

Focused on predictable releases, early defect containment, and high-confidence production deployments across AWS and Kubernetes.

Quality is engineered as a system, not validated as a phase.
