## 👋 Hi, I’m Debasish Mohanty

**SDET · Quality Engineer · Quality Intelligence Architect**

I design **Quality Intelligence systems**, not just test automation.  
My work turns **UI, API, and CI/CD test execution into release-critical insights** for cloud-native platforms.

> Quality is engineered as a system — not validated as a phase.

### 🧠 What I Focus On
- Risk-based testing & critical test impact analysis  
- CI/CD-driven quality visibility & release confidence  
- Predictable releases with early defect containment
