## 👋 Hi, I’m Debasish Mohanty

**Platform Quality Engineer (Security-Focused SDET) · DevSecOps · Cloud-Native Release Intelligence**

I **design and build** cloud-native **Quality & DevSecOps platforms** → **turning testing, security & CI/CD signals** into **risk-aware GO / NO-GO release decisions** for **Kubernetes-based systems**.

> *Quality is engineered into the platform — not tested at the end of the pipeline.*

> *I focus on building systems that enforce automated quality and security gates to reduce release risk before production.*

## 🧠 What I Work On

* **Risk-based testing** and critical test impact analysis
* CI/CD-driven **quality & security gates** for confident GO / NO-GO release decisions
* Early defect and vulnerability containment in cloud-native pipelines
* **Kubernetes-native Platform Quality Engineering** (QE evolution from 1.0 → 4.0)
* Security enforcement using **Policy-as-Code** and automated pipeline scanning
* Observability-driven release confidence using real-time signals

## 🧩 What Defines My Approach

* Treat **Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines as testable products**
* Shift quality and security **left into the delivery platform**
* Use automation signals to drive **engineering decisions**, not just reports
* Design systems that prioritize **release confidence, reliability, and risk visibility**
