## 👋 Hi, I’m Debasish Mohanty

**Quality Engineering Platform Builder · ·  Cloud-Native QA · ·  Release Intelligence**

I design Quality Intelligence systems that transform UI, API, and CI/CD test execution into release-critical insights for cloud-native platforms.
> Quality is engineered as a system — not validated as a phase.

### 🧠 What I Focus On
• Risk-based testing and critical test impact analysis  
• CI/CD-driven quality visibility and release confidence  
• Predictable releases through early defect containment  
• Cloud-native QA platforms on AWS and Kubernetes
