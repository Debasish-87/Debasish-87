## 👋 Hi, I’m Debasish Mohanty

**Platform Quality Engineer (Security-Focused SDET) · DevSecOps · Cloud-Native Release Intelligence**

I engineer **cloud-native Quality & DevSecOps platforms** that transform UI, API, security, and CI/CD signals into **risk-aware release decisions** for Kubernetes-based systems.

> *Quality is engineered into the platform — not tested at the end of the pipeline.*

> *Designed platforms enforcing automated quality & security gates across CI/CD pipelines to reduce release risk in cloud-native systems.*

### 🧠 What I Focus On

* Risk-based testing and **release GO / NO-GO decision intelligence**
* CI/CD **quality & security gates** for high-confidence deployments
* Early defect and vulnerability containment in cloud-native pipelines
* Kubernetes-native **Platform Quality Engineering (QE 1.0 → QE 4.0)**
* Security enforcement using **Policy-as-Code** and pipeline scanning
